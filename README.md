It's like the old saying goes, *When life gives you a global pandemic, make number guessing games.* This was born out of trying to keep online elementary school math fun as well as brushing up on the latest JavaScript.

It started from [a Mozilla developer page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/A_first_splash), then became a chance to play with Classes and ESLint and Prettier and Stimulus JS and Jest.

Plus, T-Rex!
